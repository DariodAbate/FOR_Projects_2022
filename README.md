# FOR Projects 2022
The development of these projects is part of the foundations of operations research	course at the Polytechnic University of Milan, held by prof. Federico Malucelli in the academic year 2022-2023.

## Small project specifications
This project provides a model to plan the two-year supply of raw materials, for a biogas power plant. In particular, we have optimized a linear programming model generated from a textual description. The full specification can be found <a href="https://github.com/DariodAbate/FOR_Projects_2022/blob/master/small-project/d_abate_corrado_cornetta.ipynb">here</a>.

## Big project specifications
This project provides a model to plan the location of farms that will supply each plant with corn chopping. In particular, we have optimized an integer linear programming model generated from a textual description. The full specification can be found <a href="https://github.com/DariodAbate/FOR_Projects_2022/blob/master/big-project/biogas_locationFinalVersion.ipynb">here</a>.
